                <h2>About Stan Lee</h2>
                <p><br>Stan Lee was an American comic-book writer, editor, and publisher, who was executive vice
                    president and publisher of Marvel Comics.<br>

                    Stan was born in New York City, to Celia (Solomon) and Jack Lieber, a dress cutter. His parents were
                    Romanian Jewish immigrants. Lee co-created Spider-Man, the Hulk, Doctor Strange, the Fantastic Four,
                    Iron Man, Daredevil, Thor, the X-Men, and many other fictional characters, introducing a thoroughly
                    shared universe into superhero comic books. In addition, he challenged the comics' industry's
                    censorship organization, the Comics Code Authority, indirectly leading to it updating its policies.
                    Lee subsequently led the expansion of Marvel Comics from a small division of a publishing house to a
                    large multimedia corporation.<br><br>

                    He had cameo appearances in many Marvel film and television projects, with many yet to come,
                    posthumously. A few of these appearances are self-aware and sometimes reference Lee's involvement in
                    the creation of certain characters.<br><br>

                    On 16 July 2017, Lee was named a Disney Legend, a hall of fame program that recognizes individuals
                    who have made an extraordinary and integral contribution to The Walt Disney Company.<br><br>

                    Stan was married to Joan Lee for almost 70 years, until her death. The couple had two children. Joan
                    died on July 6, 2017. Stan died on November 12, 2018, in LA.
