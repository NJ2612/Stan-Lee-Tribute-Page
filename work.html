                With an upgraded version of the Flash and later with the Justice League of America super-team, DC Comics editor Julius Schwartz successfully revitalised the superhero archetype in the late 1950s. Martin Goodman, the publisher, tasked Lee with creating a fresh group of superheroes in response. Lee's wife recommended that because he was preparing to change careers and had nothing to lose, he try stories he liked. Lee took the advice to heart and changed the idealised archetypes generally penned for preteens by giving his superheroes flaws and flawed humanity.

                Before this, the majority of superheroes were idealistically perfect individuals without any significant, long-lasting issues. Complex, realistic characters with nasty tempers, sad mood swings, and displays of vanity were introduced by Lee. These characters quarrelled with one another fretted about impressing their lovers and paying their debts, and occasionally even became ill from boredom.

                The Fantastic Four were the first superheroes Lee and illustrator Jack Kirby produced jointly. Due to the team's immediate success, Lee and Marvel's illustrators created a flood of new books. Again collaborating with Kirby, Lee co-created the Hulk, Thor, Iron Man, and X-Men; with Bill Everett, Daredevil; and with Steve Ditko, Doctor Strange; all of whom existed in a wholly shared universe with Spider-Man, Marvel's most famous character. The Avengers, a grouping of Lee and Kirby's newly developed characters, would bring back heroes from the 1940s like Captain America and the Sub-Mariner. Later, Kirby and Lee would argue about who should be given the credit for coming up with The Fantastic Four.

                Beyond the plots and characters, Lee revolutionised the way comic books drew in readers and fostered a feeling of community among readers and producers. He established the custom of routinely listing the writers, pencillers, inkers, and letterers in a credit panel on the splash page of each story. The Bullpen Bulletins page, which was written in the same conversational tone as the letter columns that appeared in each book, regularly featured news about Marvel staff members and planned stories.

                During a time when letters to other comic book publishers were often addressed "Dear Editor," Lee noted that his goal was for fans to think of comic book creators as friends, and he considered it a sign of his success on this front that letters to Marvel addressed the creators by the first name (e.g., "Dear Stan and Jack"). In 1965, Lee taped messages for the newly established Merry Marvel Marching Society fan organisation. Will Success Spoil Spiderman? was the subject of a March 3 WBAI radio programme with Lee and Kirby as guests. By 1967, the brand had become sufficiently entrenched in popular culture.

                Lee also favoured the use of comic books as a kind of social commentary on contemporary issues, particularly those involving racism and hate. Along with promoting a forthcoming comic book, "Stan's Soapbox" also discussed prejudice, intolerance, and discrimination. Lee ceased penning monthly comic books in 1972 to take on the position of publisher. His final appearances in The Amazing Spider-Man were in issue #110 (July 1972) and Fantastic Four #125. (August 1972).

I don't think superpowers automatically means there won't be any personality problems, family problems or even money problems. I just tried to write characters who are human beings who also have superpowers."
