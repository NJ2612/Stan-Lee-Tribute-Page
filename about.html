                <h2>Biography</h2>
                <p>Stan Lee (1922–2018) was a visionary writer, editor, publisher, and producer who became a defining
                    figure in the comic book industry. Born Stanley Martin Lieber on December 28, 1922, in New York
                    City, he grew up in a working-class family during the Great Depression. His early love for books and
                    films sparked a passion for storytelling that would shape his career.</p><br>
                <p>Lee began working for Timely Comics, the predecessor to Marvel Comics, in 1939 at the age of 17.
                    Starting as an assistant, he quickly rose through the ranks, eventually becoming editor-in-chief. In
                    the 1960s, Lee, alongside artists like Jack Kirby and Steve Ditko, revolutionized the comic book
                    world. Together, they created legendary characters such as Spider-Man, the X-Men, Iron Man, the
                    Hulk, Thor, Black Panther, Doctor Strange, and the Fantastic Four. These characters stood apart for
                    their human flaws, emotional depth, and complex relationships, making them relatable to readers in a
                    way that was unprecedented.</p><br>
                <p>Lee’s work emphasized social issues and moral dilemmas, weaving contemporary themes like civil rights
                    and personal responsibility into the adventures of his superheroes. His writing style, marked by its
                    humor and drama, resonated with fans, while his "Stan’s Soapbox" columns brought a personal touch
                    that strengthened the bond between Marvel and its readers.
                </p><br>
                <p>As Marvel grew, Lee became its public face, promoting its stories and characters across the globe.
                    Under his leadership as publisher, Marvel evolved into a major entertainment brand. In the 21st
                    century, his creations leapt from page to screen, driving the success of the Marvel Cinematic
                    Universe. Lee made memorable cameo appearances in many of these films, delighting fans with his
                    signature charm.</p><br>
                <p>Throughout his life, Lee received numerous accolades, including a National Medal of Arts and
                    induction into the Will Eisner Comic Book Hall of Fame. His legacy as a pioneer of modern
                    storytelling and a champion of imagination endures, inspiring generations to dream, create, and
                    embrace the hero within. i need to implement this in the about page</p><br>
